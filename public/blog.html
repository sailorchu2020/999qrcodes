                Hey! This is the first official blog post. Very exciting! For this first blog topic, I'd like to secure the beginning of "999qrcodes". However, this "999qrcodes" isn't referring to this site. Let me go into depth… 
                <br><br>
                In my health class recently, we were taught about goals. How to create them, set a plan, putting in the work to reach that goal, etc. While it was a very straightforward lesson, it made me realize that I've never truly set a goal for myself, let alone commit to one. I don't mean something like getting homework done by the end of the week, it's more in the sense of a personal project for self-fulfillment. So, I decided to come up with one. 
                <br><br>
                I want to study computer science, and I thought it'd be fun to work on a long-term programming project before college application season really kicks in. One of my favorite video games of all time is 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors. Combining the two, we now have my new proposal: "9 Weeks, 9 Languages, 9 Projects". Cool, right? …Riiiight?
                <br><br>
                This project will span 9 weeks, and it will start on the first day of September, the 9th month of the year. The goal is to learn the basics of 9 programming languages and create 9 projects in 9 weeks. I'll dedicate each week to learning about one programming language, and create a small project by the end of the week using it. Thus, we have 999qrcodes. 9 [Weeks], 9 [Languages], 9 [Projects] [that] QR codes. (My initials are QR.)
                <br><br>
                I expect to reach my goal by October 19. I also intend to include documentation of the project in the Archive when it's finally ready. I'm excited, but hope I can really commit to this. My main reason for making this the first post is that if I don't solidify it somewhere, it'll decrease the chance I'll stay interested in it. Since this is posted for many to see, I expect to feel a bit pressure to keep up with the project.
                <br><br>
                That's all. Thank you for reading!

                Hello! Today is the official first day of the 999qrcodes project. Week 1 will feature the programming language… C++! 
                <br><br>
                I'm very excited about this. Please keep in mind that I will not be doing crazy, complex projects, as I have a lot going on outside of this project. Although, I wish I had more time to code. By the end of this week, I hope to update this again. Also, I am working on the "Interests" tab right now.

              <p>I meant Javascript, not C++!</p>
              <br>
              <p>I've decided to modify the 999qrcodes project to be more… realistic. It took me a while to get to where I am with HTML and CSS (and even then I'd barely consider myself an amateur), so why should I assume that I could learn the basics of a new coding language every week? I just don't want to make it too hard on myself. However, I still want to pursue some sort of project to improve my skills. </p>
              <br>
              <p>So, here is my new proposal: 9 Weeks, 9 Projects, 9 Features. Instead of studying different languages every week, I figured it would be better if I continued to study the ones I'm already somewhat familiar with (HTML, CSS) and develop more of that frontend knowledge with Javascript, which I know very little about. It's definitely less stressful that way, and in the end, this site benefits as well.</p>
              <br>
              <p>With that being said, it's the last day of the first week, and the first project is done! I created this <a href="/999qrcodes-project/week1.html" target="_blank">QR code generator</a>. It was a simple and straightforward project that I think is a great starting point. I feel like it's going to take a while for me to grow comfortable with Javascript's syntax, but that's the whole point of this! I was not only super busy but also very ill this entire week, so I'm grateful that I was able to get this out against all odds. See you next week!</p>

                <br>
                <p>This year I want to develop better mindset habits. The high school cycle has ingrained a routine in myself that has made me feel stressed many times, including very recently. But, there's nothing I can do to change that. My school obviously won't change the way it's been running for the past three years that I've been here, so the only thing I can change is myself. More specifically, I can change my mindset. Better late than never, right?</p>
                <br>
                <p>With everything coming right at me right now, it's important to stay healthy while grounding myself in what I need to do right now. Right now, I'm too focused on the latter. In fact, I'm so grounded, I might have well reached Earth's core… Anyways, my point is that I'm just blindly doing stuff like assignments and studying without any sort of concern for my own health, mentally and physically.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To help dig me up back to the surface of Earth, here's some things that I'll try to start doing.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Take after-school naps.</strong></p>
                <p>Many days, I find myself battling the urge to doze off in my english class in the afternoon. It's really not that I don't get enough sleep, it's just that I easily get drained after half a day of school. However, usually once I get home, I get straight to working on assignments. I think this is slowly killing me. Maybe about 30 minutes to an hour in my bed before working would benefit me, since it'll refresh my brain. Plus, it fulfills the desires of sleepy fifth period Q.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Thinking more positively.</strong></p>
                <p>It's really tempting to let out a big sigh when something like fifty problems of math homework gets assigned on top of the monstrous workload I already have from other classes. But I can see it as an opportunity to practice the new lesson. Fifty questions may be a lot, but perhaps they're all very short? It's also likely that they repeat the same concepts over and over, so I'd get a good training session for that topic. That was just an example. If I approached other things in this way, I would definitely feel more motivated to get stuff done.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Being more grateful.</strong></p>
                <img src="decorations/akane_smile.gif" class="decoration-main-small" style="float: right;">
                <p>It's easy to focus on the negative parts of life. If I get a 99% score on a hundred-question quiz, I'm not focusing on the ninety-nine questions I got right, I'm looking for the one question I got wrong. While it's crucial that you acknowledge that life isn't perfect and there's lots of bad things, there's lots of beautiful things in life that I often take for granted. I'm grateful for the people in my life. My relationships all took a long time to build, and I am constantly building old and new ones every day. Even today's date, 9/9/2025 is special. There are two 9s in a row, but if you take the digital root of 2025, 2 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 9, you get 9/9/9! Isn't that so cool? </p>
                <br>
                <p>That's it. I would love it if more people became more open-minded and positive. I hope reading this encourages you to make a change in your own life. Little things can really go a long way being stacked over time, so don't think any small improvement is too insignificant to pursue.</p>
