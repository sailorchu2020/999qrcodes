          August 28, 2025 - 999qrcodes
        </div>
          <div class="blog-content">
            <p>
              Hey! This is the first official blog post. Very exciting! For this first blog topic, I'd like to secure the beginning of "999qrcodes". However, this "999qrcodes" isn't referring to this site. Let me go into depth… 
              
              In my health class recently, we were taught about goals. How to create them, set a plan, putting in the work to reach that goal, etc. While it was a very straightforward lesson, it made me realize that I've never truly set a goal for myself, let alone commit to one. I don't mean something like getting homework done by the end of the week, it's more in the sense of a personal project for self-fulfillment. So, I decided to come up with one. 
              
              I want to study computer science, and I thought it'd be fun to work on a long-term programming project before college application season really kicks in. One of my favorite video games of all time is 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors. Combining the two, we now have my new proposal: "9 Weeks, 9 Languages, 9 Projects". Cool, right? …Riiiight?
              
              This project will span 9 weeks, and it will start on the first day of September, the 9th month of the year. The goal is to learn the basics of 9 programming languages and create 9 projects in 9 weeks. I'll dedicate each week to learning about one programming language, and create a small project by the end of the week using it. Thus, we have 999qrcodes. 9 [Weeks], 9 [Languages], 9 [Projects] [that] QR codes. (My initials are QR.)
              
              I expect to reach my goal by October 19. I also intend to include documentation of the project in the Archive when it's finally ready. I'm excited, but hope I can really commit to this. My main reason for making this the first post is that if I don't solidify it somewhere, it'll decrease the chance I'll stay interested in it. Since this is posted for many to see, I expect to feel a bit pressure to keep up with the project.
              
              That's all. Thank you for reading!

              Hello! Today is the official first day of the 999qrcodes project. Week 1 will feature the programming language… C++! 
              
              I'm very excited about this. Please keep in mind that I will not be doing crazy, complex projects, as I have a lot going on outside of this project. Although, I wish I had more time to code. By the end of this week, I hope to update this again. Also, I am working on the "Interests" tab right now.
              
              Thank you for reading!

            <p>I meant Javascript, not C++!</p>
            
            <p>I've decided to modify the 999qrcodes project to be more… realistic. It took me a while to get to where I am with HTML and CSS (and even then I'd barely consider myself an amateur), so why should I assume that I could learn the basics of a new coding language every week? I just don't want to make it too hard on myself. However, I still want to pursue some sort of project to improve my skills. </p>
            
            <p>So, here is my new proposal: 9 Weeks, 9 Projects, 9 Features. Instead of studying different languages every week, I figured it would be better if I continued to study the ones I'm already somewhat familiar with (HTML, CSS) and develop more of that frontend knowledge with Javascript, which I know very little about. It's definitely less stressful that way, and in the end, this site benefits as well.</p>
            
            <p>With that being said, it's the last day of the first week, and the first project is done! I created this <a href="999qrcodes-project/week1.html" target="_blank">QR code generator</a>. It was a simple and straightforward project that I think is a great starting point. I feel like it's going to take a while for me to grow comfortable with Javascript's syntax, but that's the whole point of this! I was not only super busy but also very ill this entire week, so I'm grateful that I was able to get this out against all odds. See you next week!</p>

              <p>This year I want to develop better mindset habits. The high school cycle has ingrained a routine in myself that has made me feel stressed many times, including very recently. But, there's nothing I can do to change that. My school obviously won't change the way it's been running for the past three years that I've been here, so the only thing I can change is myself. More specifically, I can change my mindset. Better late than never, right?</p>
              
              <p>With everything coming right at me right now, it's important to stay healthy while grounding myself in what I need to do right now. Right now, I'm too focused on the latter. In fact, I'm so grounded, I might have well reached Earth's core… Anyways, my point is that I'm just blindly doing stuff like assignments and studying without any sort of concern for my own health, mentally and physically.</p>
              
              <p>To help dig me up back to the surface of Earth, here's some things that I'll try to start doing.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Take after-school naps.</strong></p>
              <p>Many days, I find myself battling the urge to doze off in my english class in the afternoon. It's really not that I don't get enough sleep, it's just that I easily get drained after half a day of school. However, usually once I get home, I get straight to working on assignments. I think this is slowly killing me. Maybe about 30 minutes to an hour in my bed before working would benefit me, since it'll refresh my brain. Plus, it fulfills the desires of sleepy fifth period Q.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Thinking more positively.</strong></p>
              <p>It's really tempting to let out a big sigh when something like fifty problems of math homework gets assigned on top of the monstrous workload I already have from other classes. But I can see it as an opportunity to practice the new lesson. Fifty questions may be a lot, but perhaps they're all very short? It's also likely that they repeat the same concepts over and over, so I'd get a good training session for that topic. That was just an example. If I approached other things in this way, I would definitely feel more motivated to get stuff done.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Being more grateful.</strong></p>
              <img src="images/decorations/akane_smile.gif" class="decoration-main-small" style="float: right;">
              <p>It's easy to focus on the negative parts of life. If I get a 99% score on a hundred-question quiz, I'm not focusing on the ninety-nine questions I got right, I'm looking for the one question I got wrong. While it's crucial that you acknowledge that life isn't perfect and there's lots of bad things, there's lots of beautiful things in life that I often take for granted. I'm grateful for the people in my life. My relationships all took a long time to build, and I am constantly building old and new ones every day. Even today's date, 9/9/2025 is special. There are two 9s in a row, but if you take the digital root of 2025, 2 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 9, you get 9/9/9! Isn't that so cool? </p>
              
              <p>That's it. I would love it if more people became more open-minded and positive. I hope reading this encourages you to make a change in your own life. Little things can really go a long way being stacked over time, so don't think any small improvement is too insignificant to pursue.</p>

              <p>Week 2 of the 999qrcodes project is complete!</p>
              <p>This week, I created a <a href="999qrcodes-project/week2.html" target="_blank">To-Do List</a> feature.</p>
              <p>This project was a bit more complicated than the QR code generator in terms of JavaScript. From the tutorial I used, I understood the purpose of all the functions and such, but I lack an understanding of the syntax behind it all. I think I'll try studying more of that outside of the projects. Otherwise, I'm just mindlessly copying down code.</p>
              <p>Either way, this second project is complete. This to-do list allows you to add as many tasks as you want. You can check and uncheck to keep track of finished tasks, or remove them altogether with the cross. Even if you refresh or exit out of the page, your tasks should save for the next time you visit.</p>
              <p>Very simple, but it does its job... at least I hope it does.</p>
              <p>See you next week!</p>

              <p>"999qrcodes: Week 3" is here!</p>
              <p>This week's project was a <a href="999qrcodes-project/week3.html" target="_blank">calculator</a>. Honestly, it was a lot more simple than I thought. I kind of wish I did this one before the to-do list, but I got both done anyway!</p>
              <p>I'm posting this one a bit earlier than usual. The whole project officially started on September 1st (a Monday), so I'm going by a Monday-Sunday schedule, where the feature of the week is released on Sunday. But I've decided to release Week 3 on Saturday… here's why.</p>
              <p>This week, outside of 999qrcodes, was not very good for me. I recently got a bad case of swimmer's ear. It's extremely uncomfortable and painful to deal with. 
              <p>Imagine the pain of someone pulling your ear (without someone actually pulling your ear), and on top of that, you can only hear white noise layered over the muffled sound of the world you're supposed to be hearing. That's the best way I can describe it.</p>
              <p>Besides that, a ton of other tiny bad things have happened, some being after-effects of my ear, and everything accumulated into a not-so-great week.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I've decided to release Week 3 today, because I know I'll feel better tomorrow to have the mental capacity to do my heavy assignments. Coding today would also help get my mind to start running like it used to.</p>
              <p>However, as stuff unfolded like it did these past few days, it was easy to fall down the slippery slope of doom and gloom. But I'm trying super hard to fight back. There's many positive things from this week that deserve recognition as well. Like how I had a good time bowling today. I also got over a presentation quickly yesterday. It rained here for a few days too, which was very nice to finally see this time of year. Plus, I got to work on this site! There's a bunch more good stuff too that I can't really share here, but it exists nonetheless, and it all keeps me going despite my swimmer's ear.</p>
              <p>So, I'll see you next week!</p>

              <p>The most complicated one so far, here is a <a href="999qrcodes-project/week4.html" target="_blank">weather app</a>.</p>
              <p>I think I'm getting somewhat of a grip on Javascript. If you told me to code a JS project from scratch, I wouldn't be able to do so without a tutorial, but if you pointed at any part of my previous projects and asked what the code does, I would likely have an answer. It's progress, but there's still a lot to learn.</p>
              <p>This is another early post, since I'll be quite busy tomorrow. This week was far better than last week, which I'm very happy for. My ear is completely healed now too! Also, today is the 27th, which means today is the one-month anniversary of the blog! Back when I foolishly thought about learning 9 coding languages in 9 weeks… How time flies. Here's to many more months!</p>
              <p>I'm working on something very big for this website on the side as well. Stay tuned for that!</p>
              <p>Bye for now…</p>

              <p>It's crazy to think that the entire project is over halfway done already. I'm excited to see how it plays out in the end!</p>

              <p>This week's task was to code an <a href="999qrcodes-project/week6.html" target="_blank">image gallery</a>. I was particularly excited for this one, because I plan to use this for one of the future pages of this website, the Gallery! Digital art is one of my hobbies, so I hope to share some of it in the near future, using what I learned here. The project itself was very straightforward. I recently started the Javascript course on w3schools, so lots of dots are being connected!</p>
              <p>Also, this is the new layout! I know the other one was only active for a couple months, but I decided to completely redo it now that I have a better grasp on coding and design in general. I think it's pretty neat!</p>
              <p>My next goal is to get the 999qrcodes project page up, so that all of these entries won't get buried under non-999qrcodes blogs (which I admit are very scarce right now). Goodbye for now!</p>

              <p>999qrcodes week 7 is done!</p>
              <p>This week's project is quite the deviation from the previous ones!</p>
              <p>So, for the past six weeks, I've been doing projects that are pretty general and I've had several YouTube tutorials to follow. This isn't a bad approach, but after six weeks of doing this, I decided that it'd be better to start coding without a tutorial holding my hand the entire time. With that, week 7's project is something more specific and interesting to me: a <a href="999qrcodes-project/week7.html" target="_blank">Kasane Teto keyboard</a>!</p>
              <p>Click on any key, and Teto will sing a short “ra” with the corresponding note pitch!</p>
              <p>This keyboard was super fun to make. I was having trouble figuring out how to lay out the accidentals after having the natural keys placed. However, I eventually found a way by using <em>position: absolute</em> on a grid, and offsetting it to look like piano accidentals. Then, I made the extra accidentals invisible.</p>
              <p>For the Javascript code itself, I will admit that it's just very simple functions to play the audio... I've also been using 999qrcodes to improve my HTML/CSS skills as well, so I don't see it as much of an issue, since the keyboard design was a bit of a challenge for me. On the side, I've been going through the Javascript pages from w3schools. It's unblocked on my school's computers, so I always read through it whenever I have downtime!</p>
              <p>This is definitely my favorite project so far, and I might even update it more in the future. I'll see you on week 8!! (we're nearing the end??!!)!!</p>
